## Project Description
Our game is called "Dungeon Heart". It is going to be a mediaeval-themed turn-based adventure strategy. You will have to progress through dungeons to clear the game by defeating enemies and strategically using your squad of characters that you can unlock after completing each level.

The target audience are people who enjoy logical challenges, as our game is going to involve strategy and gamers who are fancy about dungeon and mediaeval themes.

We chose this game because we believe that it has a realistically programmable/implementable concept that can pass the challenge of our limited time and technical knowledge. It also reflects our team's overall game preferences, which is important, as we want everyone to enjoy making the game we are passionate about.

## Deliverables
* A playable game

* A technical and gameplay documentation

* Work-split presentation that elucidates each member's work.

## Planning & Task Distribution
We want to have a flexible timeline that allows as-we-go concept changes and has room for new ideas. For that reason, our first goal is to make a bare-bones working skeleton of the game, with only the main concepts of the game being implemented, and then expand it with whatever ideas we like.

To achieve that, each member is going to be assigned a "field" and a corresponding task to that field. We want each member to have a specialisation, which are: one would work on the creative side, two would work on UI and logic, and one would work on databases. This way we can focus each member's attention into one niche, instead of trying to get them to do a bit of everything. One of us will also be responsible for the team's organisation, which is making tasks, assigning members to them, making group meetings and making sure that teamwork is working.

Our deadlines are not defined, but it would be great to have the game skeleton finished by the beginning of the Christmas holidays.

## Technical Approach
We are going to use the LibGDX fork Saxion GameApp as our engine, utilise any other necessary tools like TexturePacker or LibGDX Skin Composer, and have all the code written in Java.

For code sharing, we are going to use GitHub, as it is integratable into the IntelliJ IDE that we use. It also has a function of commit reviews, which is great for monitoring what code is being added into the game.

Code will be strictly structured into folders and separate files to avoid spaghetti code. Screens, classes, etc. will be logically structured into folders and files that correspond to them. The code must be clean and readable, with comments included where needed, and camelCase present at all times.

## Risks
Our greatest risks are:

* Critical discrepancies in the initial design/concept of the game and our technical/coding abilities.

* Disagreements inside the team.

How are we going to address them?

* It is each member's responsibility to make sure that their task is within their capabilities, and they must communicate with other members if they run into any problems they can't solve. Ultimately, we are open to changes, so even if we have any critical flaws in the game concept, we can alter it as we go.

* A democratic way of resolving disagreements is preferred. If the majority is against something, it probably will not happen, unless the team is convinced. Each team member must contribute his own ideas to the game but, at the same time, make sure that everyone will be happy with the idea in question.

## Collaboration Agreements
Our main way of communication is going to be via our WhatsApp group, during classes or group meetings. We expect each member to be a valuable asset to the game development and our team's collaboration. Complete their tasks on time, to not let the team down and bring their own creativity into the game. Our Code of Conduct is not defined, as we want our workspace to be relaxed and friendly; just bring value to the game's development, teamwork and our team in general.
